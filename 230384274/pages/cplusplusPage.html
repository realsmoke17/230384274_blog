            <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language. It provides object-oriented features and low-level memory manipulation, making it suitable for both system programming and application development.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of C++</h2>
            <ul class="advantages-list">
              <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C++ is known for its speed and efficiency, making it ideal for resource-intensive applications.</li>
              <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> C++ supports OOP, which helps in building reusable, modular code with classes and objects.</li>
              <li><strong>Low-Level Manipulation:</strong> C++ allows direct manipulation of memory, which is critical for system-level programming.</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> C++ can be compiled and run on different platforms with minimal changes in code.</li>
              <li><strong>Rich Library Support:</strong> C++ has a large standard library and additional libraries that simplify development for various tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Can You Do with C++?</h2>
            <p>C++ is a versatile language used in a wide range of applications. Here are some common things you can do with C++:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> C++ is widely used in game engines like Unreal Engine because of its performance and efficiency.</li>
              <li><strong>System Programming:</strong> Operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems are often developed using C++.</li>
              <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> C++ is used for developing high-performance applications such as databases, browsers, and more.</li>
              <li><strong>Competitive Programming:</strong> Due to its speed, C++ is the preferred language for competitive programmers worldwide.</li>
              <li><strong>Scientific Computing:</strong> C++ is commonly used in scientific and mathematical computations where performance is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
